Hello World! Added the functionality to allow the player to play multiple rounds of blackjack within the game. I've limited the amount of rounds to 10 just to make it simple. Also discovered a bug when the player had 21 but the dealer busted. Issue was I forgot to add less than or equal to 21 and simply had less than 21 so a hand of 21 would lose to a hand that should have busted.

I also made some simple changes to the background of the website. Feel free to give me some feedback on it! For those curious, I used background images provided by https://theultralinx.com/tag/wallpapers/. They have a lot of cool free images from different artists. I'm thinking I will start messing around with more of the font and colors for the site next. The index page also seems to be a bit barren of information/content so I am thinking about how to improve that as well.

That's it for now.
