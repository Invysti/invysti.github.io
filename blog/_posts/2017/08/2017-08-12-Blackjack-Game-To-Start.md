Hey World! Just a quick update on the status of current projects. I decided to start coding a blackjack game before moving onto Texas Holdem just as a way to practice using Array Lists to setup a deck of cards. There has been some pretty good progress so far and I've gotten the data structure to function the way a deck would. Although I'm sure there are some inefficiencies in my code I'm pretty satisfied with how it's currently working.

The game currently deals cards to the player and the computer and then can prompt the player whether they would like to hit or hold up until the player chooses to hold or busts. I don't expect the computer code to be too difficult since they will simply hit until they reach 17 or bust. The next biggest hurdle will be to allow for differentiation between the aces. I have a general idea on how to make that work but haven't implemented yet.

Texas Hold'em will be coming up after Blackjack is complete. I'm thinking about using probability tables to simulate AI for the computers depending on their hand and what is on the board. How difficult that will be remains to be seen. Anyways, that's it for today. Peace!
