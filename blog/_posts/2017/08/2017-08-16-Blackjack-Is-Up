Hello World! The blackjack game is up and can be found on the projects page or my github page. Functionality so far is relatively simple with the user inputting their name. Afterwards, the cards will be dealt and the user will be asked whether they would like to hit or to hold. The user is allowed to hit as long as their total is less than or equal to 21. After the player's turn, the computer will hit as long as their total is less than 17.

There are still a number of improvements to be made to the program. Mainly there is some redundancy and abstraction improvements to be made on the player's turn and the computer's. Some takeaways from this project was the need to consider Aces being two values as well as the data structure used for the deck of cards. I went with an ArrayList with Card objects which had enums for the value and the suit but I'm sure there are other ways that are probably better.

I will probably work on the redundancy and abstraction in my spare time but overall I'm pretty happy with how the project turned out. Some other points of improvement could be in how the information is output to the user as well as how abrupt the game seems to end. I think this would be a great project to revisit later in the future to try and implement a GUI.
