Hey guys, just wanted to give you all a quick update after Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas area. Unfortunately, my house was hit pretty hard and flooded approximately five feet. Fortunately, my family and I were able to evacuate to my brothers' house which did not flood. However, the majority of my belongings as well as my cars have all been lost. We've begun the path towards recovery and are working things out with our insurance companies so hopefully that works out sooner rather than later.

I was able to save my laptop so I'm still slowly working on projects currently but with things at the house being a mess and school resuming, I will do my best to pick up the pace on those but no promises. Also trying to work a bit more on my knowledge on data structures and algorithms using MOOCs in order to position myself better for recruiting.

That's it for now.
