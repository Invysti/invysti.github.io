Hello, World! Welcome to my website and blog! My name is Chris but I go by the alias Invysti on the Internet. A little bit about me, I am an aspiring programmer based in the Texas area. I am actually a CPA (certified public accountant) with a Master's Degree in Accounting. However, I'll be returning to school this fall for a Post-Baccalaureate in Computer Science after discovering my passion for programming. The main purpose of this website and blog is to catalog my journey through programming as well as to keep myself on track and accountable to finish the projects that I start.

The site is extremely basic at the moment but I am working on it! As you can tell, the formatting isn't that great. I'm hosting it through GitHub Pages using Jekyll and Bootstrap just to make it easy. I'm currently using the Grayscale theme provided by Start Bootstrap. Check the theme out here https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/ or check out the other awesome themes that they have! I'll be personalizing and changing the theme over time for a more distinct look so stay tuned for that.

I'm still fairly new to programming having only studied it on my own for about half a year so far. No projects to add to the site or my GitHub page as of now. I have a couple of basic programming projects from online courses I have taken but I felt like I should add more personal projects instead of assignments from courses. I'm thinking a basic probability calculator for Texas Hold'em would be pretty interesting and fun to work on.

I'm also highly interested in game development but no projects on that end yet as I'm still getting a grasp on gaming engines and learning their interfaces. However, I'm thinking about a basic 2D platformer as a start.

Anyways, that's it for now. Time for me to get back to work!
