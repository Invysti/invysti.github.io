Hello, World, welcome back! Just a short update to let you know that I've started working on the Hold'em Probability calculator. I'm currently writing it in Java. Have done some preliminary functionality but have already come to the difficulty on which data structure to use for the cards. Since I haven't taken data structures yet, this has basically led to a bunch of googling as to what data structure might be best for the program.

The main consideration lies in there being both numbers and suits so I was originally thinking about having an enum for the numbers and an enum for the suits with an ArrayList identical to Oracle's tutorial on enums but I'm not too sure how well this will work. Going to need to do more googling on this but it's been a great learning experience already. I'll also need to think about how cards should be dealt out in a pseudo-random order and will probably need to be seeding the random number generator for ease of testing early on.

I'm also planning on updating the look of the website pretty soon. I've removed the background images already so stay tuned for those changes. I'll probably be keeping the look relatively simple since I'm not much of a designer.

That's gonna be it for this update! Back to googling for me.
