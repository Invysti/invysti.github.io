Hello, World, welcome back! Just a short update to let you know that I've started working on a simple Texas Hold'em game. I'm thinking it will be relatively simple at first with no ability to make bets since I probably won't be able to program in a system for the computer players to make bets or fold for the time being. It'll likely just deal out cards to the players and then let the user know who won. I anticipate that figuring out who won the round will be the most difficult part of the game. It probably won't be too difficult to let the player to choose whether to play or to fold based on their initial hand but any other betting mechanics afterwards will be difficult (especially the computer).

I'll be writing the game in Java with all interactions made in the command line since I haven't had any experience programming a GUI yet. However, implementing graphics for the user to interact with will be an interesting project after I get the game to start working. I was originally thinking about Texas Hold'em probabilities but that seemed to go a bit over my head so I decided to take a step back and to start off with a simple game to begin with. Implementing probability into the game might be something worth considering later in the future.

I've also made some minor updates to the website. More to come in the near future but I am still deciding what kind of design I would like to go for. I'm thinking about keeping it pretty simple since I'm not much of a designer but stay tuned for the changes! That's it for this update, next update will likely be once I get a preliminary version of the game up.
