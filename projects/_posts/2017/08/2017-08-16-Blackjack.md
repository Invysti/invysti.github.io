title: Blackjack
meta: Blackjack is a basic program that allows the user to play a game of blackjack against the computer. Cards are objects that hold a value and a suit as enums. The cards objects are then stored in a deck ArrayList and are shuffled using Java's shuffle method from the collections object. Normal blackjack rules apply and the user is allowed to hit as long as their total is less than or equal to 21. The computer will hit as long as its total is less than 17.
